<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
  This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected,
  used, and shared when you visit or use Bar My Codes (the “Site”).
</p>

<h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
<p>
  The Site does not directly collect any personally identifiable information.
  However, some personally identifiable information will be automatically
  collected during the regular usage of the Site. This information is explained
  below.
</p>

<h3>Device Information</h3>
<p>
  When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information
  about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address,
  time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device.
  Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the
  individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search
  terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact
  with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as
  “Device Information.”
</p>
<p>
  We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for
  potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more
  generally to improve and optimize the Site (for example, by generating
  analytics about how our users browse and interact with the Site, and to
  assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
</p>

<h3>Analytics</h3>
<p>
  We use an internal analytics tool to collect basic usage data about the Site. The
  analytics does not collect any personally identifiable information and will not place
  any cookies on your system.

  are talking both about all information listed above.

  or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise
  protect our rights.
