# barmycodes
**Work in Progress:** A simple barcode generation service.

This project is a replacement for the original [barmycodes app](https://github.com/robyparr/barmycodes-legacy) which was written in Python. I haven't done any Python development since and I've had issues with it failing to start due to dependencies failing to install and so I decided to rewrite it in a language I'm currently using, with the hope that it 1) won't fail to start and 2) I'll be able to more easily troubleshoot it if it does.
